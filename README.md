# VisionGuard

**VisionGuard** is a web-based image classification application powered by a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system allows users to upload an image, and it predicts the class of the image along with a confidence score. It is designed to provide fast, accurate, and visually intuitive predictions, displaying results side-by-side with the uploaded image for a seamless user experience.

VisionGuard is built with a **FastAPI backend** for handling model inference and a **Next.js frontend** for a responsive, modern interface. The frontend communicates with the backend API to send images and receive predictions in real-time. The application supports both light and dark themes and offers a professional, clean UI suitable for both research and demonstration purposes.

Key features:

- Upload images and get real-time predictions
- Displays uploaded image and prediction side-by-side
- Confidence score for model predictions
- Clean, modern, and responsive UI with dark/light mode
- Easy to configure with your own trained CNN model
- Backend built with FastAPI and TensorFlow/PyTorch for flexibility

VisionGuard is suitable for applications like:

- Research and prototyping of image classification models
- Educational demos and AI showcases
- Lightweight deployment for custom image recognition tasks

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**

```bash
cd VisionGuard/backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn pillow tensorflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
exit
```

2. **Place your trained CNN model in the backend folder.**
The default path is specified in app/model.py:

MODEL_PATH = "app/my_cnn_model.h5

3. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
4. **Access the backend API:**
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
## Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
```bash
cd VisionGuard/frontend
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash

npm install
```
3. **Start the frontend server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```
4. **Start the frontend server:**
Frontend runs at:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
## Running the Application

```bash
cd VisionGuard/backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
